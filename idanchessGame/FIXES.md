# Chess Game Code Fixes

This document outlines the issues found in the chess game implementation and provides fixes.

## Issues Found

1. **Checkmate Detection Bug**
   - In `Board.java`, the `isCheckmate()` method was incorrectly checking for check after making a move.
   - It was using `isKingInCheck(!whiteToMove)` when it should have been checking if the current player's king was still in check.

2. **Stalemate Detection Bug**
   - In `Board.java`, the `isStalemate()` method had a logic error that could lead to infinite loops.
   - The method was checking each move individually instead of using the existing `getLegalMoves()` method.

3. **Performance Issues**
   - The stalemate detection method had performance problems causing timeouts in tests.

## Fixed Implementations

The fixed implementations are:

### Fixed Checkmate Detection

```java
/**
 * Checks if the game is in checkmate.
 *
 * @return true if checkmate
 */
public boolean isCheckmate() {
    // Must be in check for checkmate
    if (!isKingInCheck(whiteToMove)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Get legal moves directly
    List<Move> legalMoves = getLegalMoves();
    
    // If there are no legal moves and king is in check, it's checkmate
    return legalMoves.isEmpty();
}
```

### Fixed Stalemate Detection

```java
/**
 * Checks if the game is in stalemate.
 *
 * @return true if stalemate
 */
public boolean isStalemate() {
    // Not stalemate if king is in check
    if (isKingInCheck(whiteToMove)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Get legal moves directly
    List<Move> legalMoves = getLegalMoves();
    
    // If there are no legal moves and king is not in check, it's stalemate
    return legalMoves.isEmpty();
}
```

## Testing Results

1. **Checkmate Detection**:
   - Successfully tested with a position where the white king is in check from two black queens with no escape.
   - The fixed implementation correctly identifies this as a checkmate.

2. **Draw Detection**:
   - Insufficient material detection was tested and works correctly.
   - A king vs. king position is properly identified as a draw by insufficient material.

## Key Improvements

1. The fixed implementations are:
   - More efficient: They leverage the `getLegalMoves()` method which already exists
   - More reliable: They avoid redundant code and potential infinite loops
   - More accurate: They correctly identify checkmate and stalemate positions

2. The key insight was that the original code was making moves to check for checkmate but looking at the wrong side's king afterward.

## Implementation Steps

1. Replace the `isCheckmate()` method in Board.java with the fixed version above.
2. Replace the `isStalemate()` method in Board.java with the fixed version above.
3. Consider adding more test cases that cover different checkmate and stalemate positions.

These changes will ensure the chess game correctly identifies end-game conditions, improving the overall player experience.
